# Jacks-Weather-Dash
Using server-side APIs I want to create a weather dashboard so that travelers can look for the forecast in multiple cities and plan accordingly.

# Description 
This is a weather display dashboard that allows the user to search their city of choice and be presented with a forcast for the following days so they can travel safely and pack appropriately

# How to use 
Load up Jacks-weather-dash and search for your city in the text box, when you search the city you were looking for should appear with a forcast, this website will also log your searches in the localStorage

# Made with 
-HTML
-CSS
-JavaScript
-Bootstrap
-JQueury
-Weather API

# Help
I did do some research on this project since I struggled and found repositories that I referenced, I did try my best to write my own code but I am still stuck and don't just want to copy it completely 
I also plan on going over it with a tutor as soon as possible
