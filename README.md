# Jacks-Weather-Dash
Using server-side APIs I want to create a weather dashboard so that travelers can look for the forecast in multiple cities and plan accordingly.

# Description 
This is a weather display dashboard that allows the user to search their city of choice and be presented with a forcast for the following days so they can travel safely and pack appropriately
